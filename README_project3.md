##  What is working
Building of Routing Table for all nodes in the network.
Join Operation of a new node.
Counting hops for a given number of requests for every node.
Printing of HopCount for Each Request.

## Steps for Code Execution
1. Unzip "Kulkarni_Kavikondala"
2. Go to "Project3" file.
3. In the terminal run,

mix run project3.exs numNodes numRequests

  Example,
	`mix run project3.exs 500 10`
	


## What is the largest network you managed to deal with?
Largest Network dealt with is of;
NumNodes = 5000
numRequests = 10

## Sample Output

    >mix run project3.exs 1000 5
    Number of Nodes: 1000
    Number of Requests: 5
    Build Routing Tables for each node in network.
    Join a new node in the existing network.
    Sending Requests to nodes
